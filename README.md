# 🤯We will be creating a "virus" 🤯
🟥Please note:
This is not a real virus
#
😋🤷‍♂️And yes, sorry for my bad english...
# 🌴The basics🌴
Step 1. Press ⊞Win+R.
#
Step 2. Enter it in the *text box* **notepad**.
#
And write the code to the note in the notepad.
The code is this:

**msgbox "*This is the part when you can write your text here*"**
#
Now, click on save as... and select All files. Now select the folder and put the file format to vbs.
# 🔥Make the code more virusy!🔥
If you are want to loop this text, write this to the code:
**loop**
#
So your code maybe looks like this:


```
msgbox "This is the part when you can write your text here"
loop
```

# 💪Lets turbo it!💪
Create a new shortcut on your desktop. Name it whatever you want. For this example i will be name it to Google Chrome.
#
Set the location where you saved the vbs file.
#
Now select the icon to make this shortcut more sus... 
#
Right click on the file. Click on Properties. Select Icon replacement. And replace it with any icon. If you are want to replace it with one of your apps write the text box your app's location. For example: %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
# 😎And now we done!
